Network Programming
===================

Python provides support for Socket Programming and has libraries like Async IO, gevent, Twisted, Tornado etc. Network Applications are being developed with great features provided by Python language.

Networking
----------

*Libraries for networking programming.*

* [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) - (Python standard library in Python 3.4+) Asynchronous I/O, event loop, coroutines and tasks.
* [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) - A Web framework and asynchronous networking library.
* [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) - An event-driven networking engine.
* [pulsar](https://github.com/quantmind/pulsar) - Event-driven concurrent framework for Python.
* [diesel](https://github.com/jamwt/diesel) - Greenlet-based event I/O Framework for Python.
* [pyzmq](http://zeromq.github.io/pyzmq/) - A Python wrapper for the ZeroMQ message library.
* [txZMQ](https://github.com/smira/txZMQ) - Twisted based wrapper for the ZeroMQ message library.

Network Virtualization and SDN
------------------------------

*Tools and libraries for Virtual Networking and SDN (Software Defined Networking).*

* [Mininet](http://mininet.org/) - A popular network emulator and API written in Python.
* [POX](http://www.noxrepo.org/pox/about-pox/) - An open source development platform for Python-based Software Defined Networking (SDN) control applications, such as OpenFlow SDN controllers.
* [Pyretic](http://frenetic-lang.org/pyretic/) - A member of the Frenetic family of SDN programming languages that provides powerful abstractions over network switches or emulators.
* [SDX Platform](https://github.com/sdn-ixp/internet2award) - SDN based IXP implementation that leverages Mininet, POX and Pyretic.
* [Ryu](http://osrg.github.io/ryu/) - A component-based software with well defined API to create network management and control applications.
