Game Development
================

With Python you can create Awesome games. The libraries like Pygame, Cocos2d, PyOpenGL, Panda3D make this possible. Work is being done in this field to improve Python performance.

Game Development

* [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html) - Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing games.
* [Pyglet](http://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/wiki/Home) - Pyglet is a pure Python cross-platform application framework intended for game development.
* [PyOgre](http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/PyOgre) - Python bindings for the Ogre 3D render engine, can be used for games, simulations, anything 3D.
* [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/) - Python ctypes bindings for OpenGL and it's related APIs.
* [PySDL2](http://pysdl2.readthedocs.org/) - A ctypes based wrapper for the SDL2 library.
