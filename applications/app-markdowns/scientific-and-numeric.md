Scientific and Numeric
======================

Python is the language of choice in Scientific and Numeric. The libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, matplotlib, IPython makes the problems easier. Python is moving in this field at a faster pace. The focus of Python language is on Productivity and readability.

### Why Python for scientific and numeric computing?

* Very clear, readable syntax through whitespace indentation
* Strong introspection capabilities
* Full modularity, supporting hierarchical packages
* Exception-based error handling
* Interactive python console
* Dynamic data types & automatic memory management
