Embedded Python
===============

Python can be used in embedded, small or minimal hardware devices. Python is being used in Device interfacing, Robotics, Raspberry Pi, Arduino. It is used for Automating build systems and automating tests.

Hardware
--------

*Libraries for programming with hardware.*

* [ino](http://inotool.org/) - Command line toolkit for working with [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/).
* [Pyro](http://pyrorobotics.com/) - Python Robotics.
* [PyUserInput](https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput) - A module for cross-platform control of the mouse and keyboard.
* [scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/) - A brilliant packet manipulation library.
* [wifi](https://wifi.readthedocs.org/) - A Python library and command line tool for working with WiFi on Linux.
* [Pingo](http://pingo.io) - Pingo provides a uniform API to program devices like the Raspberry Pi, pcDuino, Intel Galileo, etc.

Security
-------------

*Libraries for securing data on embedded devices.*

* [Virgil Security Python SDK](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-sdk-python) - An SDK which allows developers to add full end-to-end security to their existing digital solutions to become HIPAA and GDPR compliant and more using Virgil API.
* [Virgil Python Crypto Library](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-crypto-python) - A high-level cryptographic library that allows to perform all necessary operations for securely storing and transferring data.
