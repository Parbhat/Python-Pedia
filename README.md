# [Python-Pedia](https://pythonpedia.com/)

Note: Hello Pythonistas, https://pythonpedia.com  domain has a new owner and points to a new site. The domain is [transferred](https://twitter.com/pythonpedia/status/1091675818391089153). Check it out!

The content from this repo is available at https://pythonpedia.com/en/awesome/gh-35491164-01/python-one-stop-community and content will be synced periodically.

If you like the site with the heart logo ❤️, new URL is https://parbhat.github.io/Python-Pedia/ 

Only thing changed is URL of the site. There was nothing much happening with the site. It seems better to give the domain name to others to create some good stuff.
